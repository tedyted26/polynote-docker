# Polynote

## Intro (overview, key features, use in ucloud)
Polynote is an open-source polyglote notebook that provides support for Scala and integration with Apache Spark. 

We are pleased to announce the open-source launch of Polynote: a new, polyglot notebook with first-class Scala support, Apache Spark integration, multi-language interoperability including Scala, Python, and SQL, as-you-type autocomplete, and more.


Key features include:

Language interoperability: Users can seamlessly combine languages in a single notebook, leveraging the strengths of each.
Tight data integration: Dataframes and variables can be shared across languages, promoting efficiency.
Versioning and reproducibility: Polynote includes built-in version control for tracking changes and reproducing results.
Visualization support: It offers rich visualization tools for data analysis.
